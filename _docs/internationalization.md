FeatherBB can be translated to any language.

In order to do so, we decided to use PO files, which means everybody can translate FeatherBB easily.

If your language is not yet available, you can follow the instructions below.

First, download a PO editor such as [Poedit](https://poedit.net/).

Then, go to /featherbb/lang/English and see the English files for reference.

Simply copy them to a new folder having the name of the language you are translating FeatherBB into and you are ready to work.

Feel free to open a new pull request with your translation - we would be glad to add your translation to the core of FeatherBB!
