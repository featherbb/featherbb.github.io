Updating FeatherBB is very simple.

## Admin Panel

The easiest way is to use the admin panel where an "Updates" section allows you to update the core if need be.

## Composer

Running the following command in your terminal will force Composer to update FeatherBB to the latest version available.

```
composer update
```

## Copy and Paste Files

The good old way is still working. Download the latest release from GitHub, unzip it and paste the new files on top of the old ones. Since plugins does not change the core, you can do it safely.
